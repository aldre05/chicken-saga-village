# Chicken Saga Village — Project Memory

_Last updated: 2026-07-15_

## Current Objective
Build "Chicken Village" — a free, Pixiland-genre-inspired (not
IP-copied) village builder web game for the Chicken Saga brand.
Explicitly a fan/passion project: no real monetization, no NFTs, no
tokens, pending legal review. Vanilla JS + HTML5 Canvas, no framework,
localStorage only (no backend/accounts yet).

## Current Status
Repo was confirmed in sync with the codebase last session (full diff,
zero differences). This session was a bug-fix + rebalance pass on top
of that — not yet re-verified against the repo, since the fixed code
hasn't been uploaded yet. **Upload the latest zip before starting any
new session.**

## Active Tasks
1. ~~Upload this session's fixes to the repo~~ — **stale, corrected
   2026-07-16**: verified directly against the cloned repo (not
   assumed) that all of the Lucky Wheel/crafting-panel/house-capacity/
   map-layout/unlock-button fixes described below ARE present in the
   repo (commits `cb9208a`/`43897f0` and earlier). This note in
   memory.md was out of date with reality.
2. **Playtest the fixes**, especially the Lucky Wheel (both bugs were
   root-caused and fixed via code reasoning, not visual testing —
   worth confirming they look right in an actual browser).
3. Archive this session's changes into `openspec/` (no proposal was
   drafted for this batch — it was a rapid bug-fix pass in response
   to direct playtesting feedback, not a planned feature. Worth a
   short retroactive change note at minimum.)

## Completed (chronological, high-level)
See prior entries for the full build history (village MVP → resource
economy → quest board/Lucky Wheel/crafting → industrial resources).
This session added:

1. **Root-caused and fixed two real Lucky Wheel bugs**, not just
   symptom patches:
   - Segment dividers were invisible — a previous fix tried thin
     (1.5°) divider bands baked into the conic-gradient, which
     apparently render inconsistently (likely anti-aliased away).
     Replaced with actual DOM line elements, one per segment
     boundary, which don't have that failure mode.
   - Reward mismatch ("I see egg, but it says I won something else")
     — the actual bug was a coordinate-math error in label placement:
     `translate(radius, -12px)` positions a point near 3-o'clock
     *before* rotation, not 12-o'clock, so every label was rotated
     into roughly the wrong wedge relative to the color segment
     underneath it. The wheel's landing animation was always correct;
     only the visible label was wrong. Fixed the translate axes.
2. **Found and fixed a real layout bug behind "crafting doesn't
   work"**: the crafting panel and the "Press E to interact" prompt
   were positioned at identical screen coordinates, directly
   overlapping. Not a logic bug — verified crafting's underlying
   functions were correct via simulation both before and after.
3. **Upgrade costs redesigned**: now require every resource type
   currently unlocked at the player's Town Hall level (not a gradual
   "one more every 5 levels" rotation, which could mean a level-40
   building still ignored resources unlocked ages ago).
4. **House capacity increased 50%** (max 10→15/house, new formula
   3/6/9/12/15 across 5 levels) to keep pace with the resource-
   building count going from 4→6 after Quarry/Mine were added.
5. **Map layout tightened and reorganized**: resource cluster packed
   into a denser 3×2 grid, Workbench moved next to Town Hall, houses
   moved from a separate far corner to cluster right next to Town
   Hall too. Collision-verified, zero overlaps.
6. **Unlocking is now a deliberate button-click, not auto-on-E** —
   matching the same pattern already used for upgrades. A persistent
   panel now shows unlock requirements (Town Hall level + cost, with
   insufficient resources shown in red) whenever standing near any
   locked building/house, with a dedicated Unlock button. E-press on
   a locked building now shows info only.

## Next Recommended Task
Same candidates as last session, still valid (none of this session's
work was new-feature work, it was fixes + rebalance):
1. Upload this session's fixes to the repo (blocking — see Active Tasks)
2. Playtest for balance, especially: Lucky Wheel visuals, the new
   "all TH-unlocked resources" upgrade cost (may be steeper than
   intended now — worth checking it doesn't make early upgrades feel
   punishing), house capacity pacing
3. Decide egg-upkeep consequences (still a no-op at 0 egg)
4. Real art integration (still 100% placeholder)
5. Give refined goods a purpose (Chicken Feed/Plank/Brick/Ingot still
   just sit in inventory)
6. Hero/dungeon system (non-NFT version) — still just discussed, not
   proposed

## Decisions
(Carried over from prior session, still all in force — no changes
this session.)
- NFT/land ownership/revenue-share/monetization stays deferred
  pending legal review, full stop.
- Kenney.nl (CC0) is the recommended path for real art, not yet
  integrated.
- Resource role split: Egg = worker upkeep. Feathers = reserved for
  future hero system. Rice/Wood/Stone/Ore = industrial raw→refined
  lane.
- Workflow: developer uploads via GitHub web UI, not git CLI.
- Verification standard: every change gets a per-file syntax check,
  a full import-graph trace, and functional simulation tests before
  being called done — this session is a direct example of why: two
  real bugs (wheel label math, panel overlap) were found by reasoning
  through the actual code/CSS, not by assuming a prior fix worked.

## New Decision This Session
- **When a bug report says a previous fix "still" isn't working,
  re-derive the fix from scratch rather than re-applying the same
  patch.** Both wheel bugs this session were previously "fixed" in
  an earlier session but the fixes were incomplete/wrong in ways that
  weren't caught without a real browser to test in. Default to
  suspecting the earlier fix's own correctness, not just staleness of
  the build the developer is testing.

## Backend Engineer Check-In (2026-07-16)
Reviewed repo/memory to look for backend work. Confirmed: project is
still 100% client-side (vanilla JS + Canvas, localStorage only) — no
server, API, database, or auth exists or is in scope right now. No
code changes made this check-in. Asked the developer whether to start
cloud save/sync, accounts/auth, or a Hero/Dungeon backend; developer
said none of these yet.

## Bug Fix: Upgrade Cost Was Reactive to Live TH Unlock State (2026-07-16)
**Root cause (given, not re-diagnosed):** `getUpgradeCost()` in
`buildingLevels.js` called `isResourceUnlocked(resId, townHallLevel)`
against *live* game state on every call, so a building already at a
fixed level could suddenly demand a brand-new resource type the
instant something unrelated elsewhere in the village crossed that
resource's Town Hall threshold — with zero further leveling on that
building itself. Upgrade cost must be a pure function of the
building's own level only.

**Fix implemented (files modified: `js/buildingLevels.js`,
`js/main.js`):**
- Replaced the TH-reactive resource-unlock scan in `getUpgradeCost()`
  with a fixed, deterministic rotation keyed only to the building's
  own level: every `EXTRA_RESOURCE_LEVEL_INTERVAL` (5) levels, one
  more resource type is added, picked in order from
  `RESOURCE_IDS.filter(id => !(id in base))` (deterministic per
  building since `RESOURCE_IDS` order is fixed).
- Dropped the now-unused `townHallLevel` parameter from
  `getUpgradeCost`, `canUpgradeBuilding`, `upgradeBuilding`.
- Removed the unused `isResourceUnlocked` import from
  `buildingLevels.js` (still used/exported fine from `resources.js`
  itself, so no orphaned export).
- Updated all 5 call sites in `main.js` (upgrade action handler +
  4 in the upgrade-panel refresh logic, both house and resource-
  building branches) to drop the trailing `gameState.townHall.level`
  argument.

**Verification:** `node --check` on both modified files (syntax OK).
Full grep of `js/*.js` for all three function names confirmed no
remaining call site still passes a 4th/3rd `townHallLevel` arg, and
no other file imports `isResourceUnlocked` from `buildingLevels.js`.
Functional simulation (temp Node script, deleted after use) walked
Old Coop level 1→11 and confirmed cost is 100% deterministic by level
alone (same output called twice at the same level) and resource-type
count only grows at the fixed 5-level cadence, never from unrelated
state.

**Flagged discrepancy (not fixed, needs product decision):** The
task's acceptance criteria said "Old Coop to level 6 should require a
3rd resource type." With the exact formula specified, Old Coop's
own base cost already has 1 resource (`egg`), so level 6 adds a
*2nd* type (`feathers`); a 3rd type doesn't land until level 11.
`nest_bundle` (2 base resources) would hit a 3rd type at level 6
instead. Implemented the code exactly as specified rather than
silently changing the interval/base to force "3rd type at level 6"
for Old Coop specifically — needs a developer call on whether the
interval, the affected building, or the acceptance wording should
change.

**Next backend task:** None queued. Recommend developer playtest
that no building's upgrade panel changes cost when leveling an
unrelated building/unlocking a new resource elsewhere, and decide on
the flagged level-6-vs-level-11 discrepancy above.

## Frontend Verification: Upgrade-Cost Panel vs. New Deterministic Cost Shape (2026-07-16)
**Scope (given, not a code-change ticket):** confirm the building
panel's cost-preview display (`formatCostHTML`, upgrade preview text
in `main.js`) still works correctly now that Backend's Ticket 1 fix
landed (`getUpgradeCost()` no longer takes/needs `townHallLevel`).

**Findings — no code changes required:**
- All 5 call sites in `main.js` (upgrade action handler at line 182,
  plus 4 in the panel-refresh logic — house branch lines 608/610,
  resource-building branch lines 635/637) already had the
  `townHallLevel` argument removed. This was done in the same commit
  batch as Backend's fix (`5441c99`/`1556f2c`), not left dangling —
  nothing to clean up.
- `formatCostHTML` is shape-agnostic by design: it only needs
  `getUpgradeCost()` to return a plain `{resourceId: amount}` object,
  which it still does. No dependency on *how* that object was
  computed (old TH-reactive scan vs. new deterministic rotation).
- Confirmed every resource id `getUpgradeCost()` can ever emit (base
  costs + rotation-tier extras) exists in `RESOURCE_CONFIG`, since
  `RESOURCE_IDS` is derived directly from that same config object —
  so the icon lookup in `formatCostHTML` can never hit `undefined`.

**Verification performed:** `node --check` on `main.js` and
`buildingLevels.js` (syntax OK). Functional simulation (temp Node
script, deleted after use) walked every real building id
(`old_coop`, `nest_bundle`, `woodshed`, `rice_paddy`, `quarry`,
`mine`, `house_1`–`5`) across levels 1–12, checking the red
`cost-insufficient` highlighting logic against both a zero-resources
case (everything should flag insufficient) and an abundant-resources
case (nothing should) — including levels that cross the 5-level
rotation-tier boundary where a cost dict gains an extra resource
type. All passed. Also re-verified `canUpgradeBuilding()` agrees with
the same afford/can't-afford outcomes at both extremes.

**Also corrected:** the "Active Tasks" #1 item above, which claimed
last session's fixes were still un-uploaded — that was stale; direct
repo inspection this session confirmed they're all present.

**Next frontend task:** None queued from this ticket. Real in-browser
playtest of the upgrade panel (visual confirmation of red highlighting
and layout, not just logic) is still open per Active Task #2 above.

## Code Review: Full Pass (2026-07-16)
**Scope:** First dedicated code-review pass over the whole repo (all
`js/*.js`), not tied to a specific feature ticket. Read every file,
cross-checked the map layout/collision claims already in this file by
simulation rather than trusting the prior note, and looked for bugs,
security, performance, readability, duplication, and architecture
issues.

**Bug found and fixed — stale camera viewport on window resize
(`js/main.js`):** `camera` was created once via `createCamera(...,
canvas.width, canvas.height)` at load time. The `window.resize`
listener called `resizeCanvas()`, which updated the `<canvas>`
element's own `width`/`height`, but never touched
`camera.viewportWidth`/`viewportHeight` — those are the values
`camera.follow()` actually clamps panning against. Net effect: after
a player resized their browser window, the camera kept clamping to
the *original* viewport size, which could let the view pan past the
map edge (into undrawn space) or stop correctly hugging the player
near boundaries, depending on which direction the window resized.
Fixed by moving camera creation before the resize listener and having
the listener update `camera.viewportWidth`/`viewportHeight` after
every resize. (First attempt referenced `camera` from inside
`resizeCanvas()` itself before its `const` declaration — caught before
committing, since that throws a temporal-dead-zone `ReferenceError`
on the very first call. Restructured so `resizeCanvas()` stays
canvas-only and a separate resize listener updates both canvas and
camera, in the correct declaration order.) Verified: `node --check`
on `js/main.js`, plus a standalone simulation of `camera.follow()`
against a shrunk viewport confirming it now clamps to the new
(smaller) bounds instead of the stale original ones.

**Verified, not changed — map layout has zero overlaps:** re-derived
every interactable's pixel rectangle from `map.js` independently
(not trusting the existing memory.md claim) and confirmed
programmatically: no building-vs-building overlaps, no building
sits on the pond, no building sits on the border tree ring. The
"tightened, zero overlaps" claim in the Completed section above
holds up under direct recomputation.

**Reviewed with no issues found:** `resources.js`, `buildingLevels.js`,
`buildingUnlocks.js`, `workers.js`, `upkeep.js`, `crafting.js`,
`questBoard.js`, `townHall.js`, `gameState.js` (including its
multi-generation save-migration logic), `interactionHandlers.js`,
`interactions.js`, `player.js`, `render.js`. Upkeep's fractional-time
checkpointing, the resource production offline-safe timestamp
pattern, and the save-migration chain (old flat egg fields → dict
shape → grain/rice rename → per-building houses → assignment-cap
clamping) are all internally consistent and correctly ordered.

**Flagged, not changed — needs a product/deploy decision:**
`js/luckyWheel.js` still has `TICKET_INTERVAL_MS` set to 1 minute
with an explicit comment marking it as a testing value that should
become 1 hour (`60*60*1000`) "before this goes anywhere near real
players." This is a deliberate, self-documented placeholder rather
than a bug, so left as-is rather than silently changing game balance
— but it's a real pre-launch blocker worth a checklist item so it
doesn't get shipped by accident.

**All 17 `js/*.js` files pass `node --check` (fresh full-repo sweep,
not just the files touched this session).**

**Next recommended task:** No other code changes queued from this
pass. Recommend the developer playtest the resize fix specifically
(resize the browser window mid-session, then walk toward each map
edge) since it's a real behavioral change, if a small one. The
`TICKET_INTERVAL_MS` testing value above should go on whatever
pre-launch checklist exists.

## Session Log
- **This session (Code Reviewer)**: Full-repo review pass, not scoped
  to one feature. Found and fixed one real bug: the camera's
  viewport dimensions went stale on browser window resize because
  the resize handler only resized the `<canvas>` element, never
  `camera.viewportWidth`/`viewportHeight` (which `camera.follow()`
  clamps against) — could let the view pan past the map edge after a
  resize. Fixed in `js/main.js` (also caught and corrected a
  temporal-dead-zone bug in my own first attempt before committing
  it). Independently re-verified the "map layout has zero overlaps"
  claim from a prior session by recomputing all interactable
  rectangles from scratch rather than trusting the existing note —
  confirmed true. Reviewed all other `js/*.js` files with no further
  issues found. Flagged (not changed, needs a product call) that
  `luckyWheel.js`'s `TICKET_INTERVAL_MS` is still an explicit
  1-minute testing value that needs to become 1 hour before launch.
  Verification: `node --check` on all 17 `js/*.js` files, plus a
  standalone functional simulation of the camera fix. Files modified:
  `js/main.js`, `memory.md`.
- **This session**: Fixed 9 items from direct playtesting feedback:
  2 real Lucky Wheel bugs (dividers, reward-label mismatch — both
  root-caused via careful geometry/CSS reasoning, not guessed at),
  1 real layout bug (crafting panel overlapping the interact prompt),
  redesigned upgrade costs to include all TH-unlocked resources,
  increased house capacity 50%, reorganized the map layout (tighter
  resource cluster, Workbench + houses moved next to Town Hall), and
  made unlocking a deliberate button-click matching the upgrade
  pattern (with a new persistent requirements panel). All changes
  verified via syntax check + full import-graph trace + functional
  simulation. Not yet uploaded to the repo — delivered as a zip only.
- **2026-07-16 (Frontend)**: Cloned repo fresh and verified directly
  (rather than trusting memory.md's own claims) that last session's
  fixes are actually live in the repo — corrected the stale "not
  uploaded" note above. Verified the upgrade-cost preview UI
  (`formatCostHTML` + red insufficient-resource highlighting) needs
  no changes after Backend's Ticket 1 fix (`getUpgradeCost()` dropping
  `townHallLevel`) — all 5 call sites in `main.js` were already
  updated, and functional simulation across every building/level
  confirmed the highlighting logic still works against the new cost
  shape. No code changes made. Files touched: `memory.md` only.
